# URTrash 

This is the camera connection tool to help all trashcans view who is accessing and putting items into a trash can. Both humans and dolphins can currently use this.
Our goal is to have only dolphins use this, but as of right now, we want humans to feel like they can also clean up and use the machines. 

We, Jillian and Ollie, are not mechanical engineers. And any mech's who would like to help with this product can do so! 
Thank you

Also please ignore DestituteDolphin, this was our design however, due to time constraints we couldn't get it to work.
